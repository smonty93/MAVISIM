# Welcome to the Documentation for MAVISIM

MAVISIM is a tool to simulate images generated by the MCAO Assisted Visible Imager and Spectrograph (MAVIS) instrument. <a href="https://mavis-ao.org/mavis/" target="_blank">MAVIS</a> is an instrument being designed for ESO's VLT AOF (Adaptive Optics Facility, UT4 Yepun) with plans to go on-sky ~2027. 

## Version 1.0
MAVISIM 1.0 is optimised to explore the *astrometric* capabilities of MAVIS. Specifically, it utilises a Fourier approximation of the MAVIS PSF to simulate a monochromatic image (550 nm) of point sources.

<p class="admonition-title">Current Capabilities</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Simulate a full stellar field with built-in <b>PSF spatial variability</b> </li>
	<li>Optimised for astrometric studies </li>
	<li>Models three major sources of astrometric error introduced by the AO system:
		<ol>
			<li>Field variable tip-tilt residuals originating from uncorrected low-order aberrations (dependent on the natural guide star constellation brightness and geometry) </li>
			<li>Field variable high-order aberrations originating from the laser guide star constellation and characteristics </li>
			<li>Static field distortion originating from the adaptive optics module </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Current Limitations</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li> Monochromatic images only
    <li> Only compatible with an analytical approximate model of the MAVIS PSF using the Fourier method
    <li> Point source input catalogues only
</ul>
</p>

If you're not sure which version has what you need, here is a comparison of the current version with the planned upgrades in future versions.
